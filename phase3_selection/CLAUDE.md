# Phase 3: Processing

> Read `methodology/03-phases.md` → "Phase 3" for full requirements.
> Read `methodology/appendix-plotting.md` for figure standards.

You are implementing the analysis approach defined in the Phase 2 strategy
for a **measurement** analysis. Read the strategy first — it determines
what this phase must deliver.

**Start in plan mode.** Before writing any code, produce a plan: what scripts
you will write, what selection you will implement, what figures you will
produce, what the artifact structure will be. Execute after the plan is set.

**Sub-delegation.** During planning, identify tasks that are large or
independent of the main flow. Common candidates: MVA training (BDT, NN),
alternative classifier architectures, systematic variable production,
closure/stress test suites, background estimation in control regions.
Spawn these as subagents writing to separate output directories, then
integrate their results. You retain judgment (which approach wins, whether
tests pass) — subagents handle compute. See `methodology/03a-orchestration.md` §3a.5.

## Output artifact

`outputs/SELECTION.md` — final object definitions, event selection with
optimization, cutflow table, and technique-specific deliverables.

## Applicable conventions

Read the Phase 2 `STRATEGY.md` to identify the selected technique, then
open the corresponding convention file and implement every required step:

- `conventions/unfolding.md` — for unfolded measurements
- `conventions/extraction.md` — for extraction/counting measurements

The technique selected in Phase 2 determines which file applies.
Read the "When this applies" section of each to confirm.

Convention requirements (e.g., input validation before response matrix
construction, required validation checks) are **hard requirements** —
omissions are Category A at review.

## Correction infrastructure gate (measurements)

**BEFORE computing correction factors or building the response matrix:**
1. Produce data/MC comparison plots for ALL variables entering the
   observable calculation. This is a hard gate — do not proceed without
   these plots.
2. Compute the response matrix on a small MC subset (~10K events) and
   report the diagonal fraction. If < 50%, reassess the binning/method
   before building the full chain.

**If ANY validation test fails (closure, stress, alternative method):**
You MUST attempt at least 3 independent remediation approaches BEFORE
writing the artifact. Read how published analyses of the same observable
handled the correction — if they succeeded with a method you haven't
tried, try it. Documenting a failure without remediation attempts is
Category A at review.

## Figure registry (mandatory)

Register all figures in `outputs/FIGURES.json` per
`methodology/appendix-plotting.md` (full schema and fields defined there).

## RAG queries (mandatory — see executor.md "RAG Access" for toggle check)

Query the experiment corpus for:
1. Published selection criteria for similar analyses
2. Known correction factors or efficiency maps
3. Background estimation techniques used in reference analyses

Cite sources in the artifact.

## Selection approach comparison (mandatory)

Phase 3 must try at least two selection approaches before choosing one.
See `methodology/03-phases.md` → Phase 3 "Selection" for full requirements.

- [ ] Identify approaches from Phase 2 strategy
- [ ] Implement each to the point where a common figure of merit can be evaluated
- [ ] Report comparison in artifact with figure of merit for each
- [ ] Select final approach based on evidence and document rationale

If selected approach is MVA:

- [ ] Sub-delegate MVA training to a sub-agent (see §3a.5)
- [ ] Train primary classifier (BDT or NN)
- [ ] Train >=1 alternative architecture (NN if BDT, vice versa)
- [ ] Try multiclass if >2 physics classes (e.g., b/c/light)
- [ ] Produce validation plots: ROC, score distributions (train/test overlaid), feature importance
- [ ] Check data/MC agreement on classifier output — investigate before accepting systematic
- [ ] Optimize working point with figure of merit
- [ ] Save trained model, hyperparameters, split seed, validation plots as artifacts

If selected approach is cut-based, this is a downscope from the default MVA
recommendation. Document the constraint and comparison that justified the
choice (see `methodology/12-downscoping.md`).

## Sensitivity optimization (when initial selection is insufficient)

If the initial selection does not meet the physics goal, systematically
explore alternatives. Maintain a **sensitivity log** (`sensitivity_log.md`)
tracking each approach, figure of merit, and limiting factor.

Systematically explore qualitatively different strategies (not just
parameter tuning). Not all apply to every analysis type — select those
relevant:
- Optimize the current approach (tune cuts for S/sqrt(B) or equivalent)
- Try a more powerful discriminant (cut-based → BDT → GNN)
- Try different inference strategies (shape fit vs. counting, different
  discriminant variables) — primarily for searches and template fits
- Revisit region design (tighter SR, different background decomposition,
  alternative efficiency binning)

**Stop when:** sensitivity meets the goal, OR 3+ materially different
approaches tried with diminishing returns (<10% relative improvement).
Document each approach and its limiting factor.
See `methodology/03-phases.md` → Phase 3 for full details.

## Closure test alarm bands (mandatory)

These apply to Phase 3 AND Phase 4a. Read `methodology/03-phases.md` →
Phase 3 "Closure test alarm bands" for the full specification. Summary:
chi2/ndf < 0.1 = Category A (suspicious); chi2/ndf > 3 or any pull >
5-sigma = Category A (failure); `passes: false` in JSON while text claims
acceptable = Category A (misrepresentation). Do NOT frame closure failures
as "known limitations."

## Pre-review self-check

Before submitting for review, verify:

- [ ] >=2 selection approaches tried with quantitative comparison (or
      Phase 2 infeasibility exemption validated)
- [ ] Every cut motivated by a plot (N-1 distributions preferred)
- [ ] Cutflow monotonically non-increasing (investigate if not)
- [ ] For MVA: input variable quality gate table, >=1 alternative
      architecture, data/MC on classifier output
- [ ] For measurements: data/MC on all observable variables, response
      matrix diagonal fraction checked, closure test passes (or >=3
      documented remediation attempts with literature check)
- [ ] All convention requirements implemented or justified
- [ ] Analysis and plotting code separated (§11.5)
- [ ] Data plotted as black errorbar, lower panel shows pulls not ratio
- [ ] All figures pass plotting rules (see `methodology/appendix-plotting.md`)

**Your reviewer will check** (§6.4): Background model closes? Every cut
motivated by plot? Approach comparison done? MVA inputs modelled? For
measurements: correction validated?

## Review

**1-bot review** — see `methodology/06-review.md` for protocol.
Write findings to `review/{role}/` using session-named files
(see `methodology/appendix-sessions.md` for naming conventions).

## Completion Criteria (ALL must be true)

- [ ] All figures saved to outputs/figures/ AND registered in FIGURES.json
- [ ] Data/MC comparisons for all key variables

- [ ] Experiment log updated with session findings
- [ ] Plotting utilities module (src/plot_utils.py) created with standard functions:
